# TODO

## Backend

- Add aggregated model cache
- Process backend events asynchronously
  - push notification commands to AWS SNS, which calls Lambda to send emails

## Json-LD

- The relations do not contain the information about the appropriate 
  method. Look into [Hydra](http://www.markus-lanthaler.com/hydra/).
